E-mail Marketing Analytics: Email Marketing Insights Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore the impact of email marketing done by the company, focusing on click rate, open rate, and conversion rate.

This Email marketing dashboard visualizes key performance metrics from the email marketing campaign—such as open rates, click-through rates, and conversions—to help assess campaign effectiveness and optimize future strategies. It exists to provide actionable insights that drive better targeting, content refinement, and ROI for email marketing efforts.

•	📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
•	📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
•	🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
•	📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
